"AVPs introduced with this feature are S9 functionality, including the AVPs and corresponding procedures supported by the Rel8 and Rel9 standard, but excluding those features represented by separate feature bits.",0
"Each cell shows the difference in terms of equivalent Q values between the candidate and the full rate, negative values meaning worse performance than the full rate.",0
The signature algorithm using asymmetric key pairs for integrity protection is mature and widely used.,0
It allows the management systems to verify the source of the network slice subnet template which is resistant to forgery and helps for Solution #: Confidentiality protection of NSST format (e.g XML).,1
Puncturing can be used to minimise the required transmission capacity.,0
"For 3GPP purpose, Rijndael is used only in encryption mode and has the block and key length both set to 128 bits.",1
ASR vendors start tests.,2
"The block length and the key length can be independently specified to 128, 192 or 256 bits.",1
"The watcher indicated preference for partial notification in the SUBSCRIBE request, so the NOTIFY request is formulated according that has changed since the last notification.",0
The media distribution request is sent to reserve the specified capacity in the MBMS bearer distribution response to the MC service server 1 indicating whether the request can be supported and supplies details about the bearer.,0
Different approaches are studied with either the GMSC or the terminating MSC being in charge of setting the connection towards the CAT server.,0
"If the terminating MSC is the node in charge of setting the connection towards the CAT server, it routes the call towards the terminating MSC.",1
Typical MS impairments are included in the simulations.,2
This is the MSC from which the called party receives the terminating.,2
"If the terminating MSC is the node in charge of setting the connection towards the CAT server, it initiates an outgoing call to the CAT server to provide CAT-B if applicable, e.g if the called party has subscribed to be customized; it also establishes the call towards the called party and controls the through-connection, switch and release of the legs associated to the calling party, called party and CAT media.",1
"To implement PS domain online charging for roaming context, PCEF in the VPLMN uses the Gy reference point, and TDF in the VPLMN uses the Gyn reference point, both based on Ro interface and for sending charging information to an OCS in the HPLMN.",0
In order to decode the received sequence the receiver needs to know the Transport Format Combination Indicator (TFCI) field.,0
The following procedure was used for carrying out the task 1) Generation of configuration files for the Eaac+ encoder steering the encoding bit rate to toggle between various rates of interest.,0
The TFCS is signalled through the Calculated Transport Format Combinations (CTFC).,0
A high speed hybrid ARQ (HS-HARQ) mechanism for the reduction of EGPRS latency is introduced.,0
The RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete-NB message is used to confirm the successful completion of an RRC connection reconfiguration.,1
"This field is optionally present, need ON upon the first reconfiguration after RRC connection re-establishment; otherwise the field is not present.",2
The above comparison is made once for each delay range and the tone flag should be set if the condition is true at least in one range.,2
Efforts have been made to use realistic physical and link layer model.,0
This information element indicates that root termination is where the congestion mechanism is activated.,2
These URI formats shall be supported at the roaming II-NNI.,0
"While SA and NSA scenarios are included in the study, backhauling over the LTE radio interface is excluded from the study.",0
The MS_SPEED status of the MS is kept during handover or intracell channel change independent of where the handover is controlled.,1
The BM-SC shall send the HTTP response to the UE.,0
"For example, this includes MCIM applications with the needed credentials and parameters.",2
SS starts sending the corrupted blocks on the MS reselection to cell B Maximum duration of the test.,0
The number of ProSe Restricted Code Suffixes allocated shall not exceed the value in Allowed-Suffix-Number AVP in the PXR command.,1
It can be seen that the interference diversity has improved.,2
"As opposed to other header compression schemes, the whole ROHC framework has only one packet type that has to be identified by the PDU format, and this packet type can be used by any ROHC compression profile.",1
"The reason for this is that the bit MSB part of the profile identifier indicates the ""variant"" of the profile, and since only the bit LSB part is sent in compressed headers, the set of available profiles must not include two profiles with the same bit LSB part of the profile identifier.",1
"If both peer entities support more than one profile with the same bit LSB part in its profile identifier, the set of these profiles shall be reduced to the profile with the highest MSB-value in its profile identifier.",0
This routine only handles characters in the range .255 since that is all that is required for demonstration of Baudot support.,2
The hash method used to transform the code verifier to produce the code challenge.,2
In case only one PCF is deployed in the network transfer policies can be locally stored in the PCF and the interaction with the UDR is not required.,0
"If the PCF cannot retrieve the transfer policy, the PCF shall set to TP_NOT_KNOWN the ""servAuthInfo"" attribute in the HTTP response message to the AF to indicate that the transfer policy is unknown.",1
"If the time window of the received transfer policy has expired, the PCF shall set to TP_EXPIRED the ""servAuthInfo"" attribute in the HTTP response message to indicate to the AF that the transfer policy has expired.",1
"Otherwise, if the time window of the received transfer policy has not yet occurred, the PCF shall set to TP_NOT_YET_OCCURRED the ""servAuthInfo"" attribute in the HTTP response message to the AF to indicate that the time window of the transfer policy has not yet occurred or the transfer policy expired, and the PCF makes the decision without considering the transfer policy.",1
"Modification of sponsored connectivity information is used by an AF to modify sponsored data connectivity when ""SponsoredConnectivity"" feature is supported.",0
The AF shall use the HTTP PATCH method to modify the sponsored connectivity.,1
"The AF shall include in the HTTP PATCH request message described in ""sponId"" attribute, and optionally an indication of whether to enable or disable sponsored data connectivity within the ""sponStatus"" attribute set to the applicable value to provide sponsored connectivity information or to update existing sponsored connectivity information.",1
"The framework must not return more matches than the specified maximum, but it is up to the discretion of the Framework implementation to choose to return less than the specified list for those services that match the desired service property list that the service supplier provided properties {name and value list} associated with the service.",1
"If the SMF supports sponsored data connectivity feature or the required reporting level is different from sponsored connectivity level policies, it shall check whether it is required to validate the sponsored connectivity data.",1
